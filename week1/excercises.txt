Leap years occur according to the following formula: a leap year is divisible by four, but not by one hundred, unless it is divisible by four hundred.
For example, 1992, 1996, and 2000 are leap years, but 1993 and 1900 are not. The next leap year that falls on a century will be 2400.

Given a day of the week encoded as 0=Sun, 1=Mon, 2=Tue, ...6=Sat, and a boolean indicating if we are on vacation, return a string of the form "7:00" indicating when the alarm clock should ring. On weekdays, the alarm should be at "7:00" and at weekends it should be "10:00". Unless we are on vacation -- then on weekdays it should be "10:00" and weekends it should be "off".
alarm_clock(1, False) -> '7:00'
alarm_clock(6, False) -> '10:00'
alarm_clock(1, True) -> '10:00'
alarm_clock(6, True) -> 'OFF'
